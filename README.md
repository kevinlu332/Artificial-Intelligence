# Artificial Intelligence
## HW1
Implemented three different search algorithms to solve an advanved q-queen problem: there might be some obstacles on the chessboard that would block any queen from seeing another if it is in the path.
* BFS
* DFS
* Simulated Annealing

## HW2
Developed a two-player game-playing agent using Minimax with Alpha-beta pruning heuristics to find the next optimum move in limited period of time in the game Fruit Range.  

## HW3
Developed an inference engine using First-Order Logic resolution algorithm to determine whether the knowledge base entails the given queris.
